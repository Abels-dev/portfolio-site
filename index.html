                  Hi, I'm a web developer with a strong foundation in frontend
                  technologies, bringing designs to life with clean, efficient,
                  and responsive code. Recently, I've expanded my skill set to
                  include backend development, allowing me to build full-stack
                  applications that are robust and scalable.
